# Day 9 - MySQL Practice

## Task 1: Create Tables
Create two tables:
- customers
- orders

## Task 2: Insert Data
Insert records such that:
- Some customers have no orders
- Some orders have no matching customers

## Task 3: FULL JOIN (MySQL)
Since MySQL does not support FULL JOIN directly,
use UNION of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.

## Task 4: NULL Handling
Handle NULL values using IFNULL().

## Key Concepts
- FULL JOIN workaround in MySQL
- UNION
- IFNULL

## Learning Outcome
- FULL JOIN logic
- Handling missing data
