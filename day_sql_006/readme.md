# Day 6 - MySQL Practice

## Task 1: Create Table
Create a table named `sales` with:
- sale_id (INT, Primary Key)
- product_name (VARCHAR)
- category (VARCHAR)
- quantity (INT)
- price (INT)

## Task 2: Insert Data
Insert sample sales records.

## Task 3: GROUP BY
Calculate total quantity sold per category.

## Task 4: HAVING Clause
Filter categories where total quantity is greater than 5.

## Task 5: WHERE vs HAVING
- WHERE is used to filter rows before GROUP BY.
- HAVING is used to filter groups after aggregation.

## Learning Outcome
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- Difference between WHERE and HAVING
